QUES : You are tasked with implementing a basic data structure: a singly linked list.

To accomplish this, you will create two classes, Node and LinkedList.

The Node class will represent an individual node within the linked list, while the LinkedList class will manage the overall list structure.

Your implementation should satisfy the following requirements:



Create a Node class with the following features:

A constructor that takes a value as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.

A next attribute, initialized to None, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.

Create a LinkedList class with the following features:

A constructor that takes a value as an argument, creates a new Node with that value, and initializes the head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.


SOLVE : 


class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        
 
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
        self.length = 1



EXPLANATION : 

This code defines two classes: Node and LinkedList. The Node class represents a single node in a singly linked list, and the LinkedList class represents the entire singly linked list.



class Node:: This line defines the Node class.

def __init__(self, value):: This is the constructor for the Node class. It is called when you create a new instance of the Node class.

self.value = value: This line sets the value attribute of the Node instance to the value passed as an argument.

self.next = None: This line sets the next attribute of the Node instance to None. The next attribute will be used to store a reference to the next node in the linked list.

class LinkedList:: This line defines the LinkedList class.

def __init__(self, value):: This is the constructor for the LinkedList class. It is called when you create a new instance of the LinkedList class.

new_node = Node(value): This line creates a new instance of the Node class with the given value, creating the first node in the linked list.

self.head = new_node: This line sets the head attribute of the LinkedList instance to the new node. The head attribute represents the first node in the linked list.

self.tail = new_node: This line sets the tail attribute of the LinkedList instance to the new node. The tail attribute represents the last node in the linked list. Since there is only one node in the list at this point, both the head and tail point to the same node.

self.length = 1: This line sets the length attribute of the LinkedList instance to 1, indicating that there is currently one node in the linked list.
